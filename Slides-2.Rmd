# More on Aims

- A narrative, supported by citations, which should explain the logic behind the aims
- Provides an overview of the application- including brief statements about significance, innovation, approach, and impact
- Concisely state the goals of the proposed research and summarize the expected outcome(s)
- Include the impact the study results will have on the area of research
- Succinctly list the specific objectives of the research project
- Link aims of this project to overall program of research

---

# Another Specific Aims Example

- There have been many calls for upstream “social interventions” or “structural interventions” to reduce the spread of HIV and related diseases among high-risk populations and their networks.
- Research-based theoretical development about causal pathways that might be targeted in macro-level social interventions or that mediate how macro-level socioeconomic changes affect HIV epidemics has been more robust.
- Research will be hampered to the extent that we do not have valid and reliable measures for such pathways.

---

- **1.** To develop measures that theory suggests are pathways between structural interventions (or macro-level social changes) and changes in risk networks and risk behaviors. These pathways will include a.
perceived characteristics of individuals’ proximal social environments; b. how their lives are structured; and c. How individuals and groups react to normative communication (and the norms they develop).
- **2.** To assess the reliability and concurrent criterion validity of these measures.
- **3.** To describe the distributions of these variables in injection drug using, MSM and high-risk heterosexual samples. For almost all of these variables, these descriptions will provide data on never-before measured
aspects of high-risk people’s lives and social environments that can be used to plan structural interventions and to assess likely impacts of economic, social and policy changes that might occur.

# For Reviewers

- Without reading word for word, can you describe the problem the proposed work aims to solve, what is already known, and what gap will be addressed?
- Are there any parts you do not understand, or that you suspect readers may not understand?
- What suggestions do you have for making the writing clearer and more persuasive?
- What do you expect to see covered in **Significance**, **Innovation**, and **Approach** – what questions are you left with at the end of Specific Aims that you expect the rest of the proposal will answer?
