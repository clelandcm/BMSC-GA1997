# Significance Example

A.1. Even with important advances in HIV treatment [51,109,111,194,202,301], serious gaps in the domestic HIV care continuum have emerged [102,211]: of 1.2 million Americans living with HIV, 60% are not retained in HIV care; 63% are not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART); and only 30% have suppressed HIV viral load (VL) [27]. Poor engagement along the continuum increases morbidity and early mortality [150,184,205]; hospitalizations and health care costs [238,257]; and risk of forward transmission of HIV. Indeed, poor retention in HIV primary care is a principal cause of HIV/AIDS-related mortality64,104,162,237, and lack of ART initiation further places persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) at risk for substandard CD4/VL outcomes [42,130,205].

---

A.2. **Racial/ethnic disparities**. Gaps in engagement along the HIV care continuum are concentrated among African American PLHA, followed closely by Latinos [129]. African American and Latino PLHA are more likely to be diagnosed late in the course of their HIV disease, delay uptake of and discontinue ART, and have higher rates of morbidity and earlier mortality from HIV than Whites [2,6,49,225]. Racial/ethnic disparities are found among all risk groups, although African American and Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) evidence the highest domestic HIV incidence rates [43,263]. The CDC, Office of AIDS Research [216], and 2015 National HIV/AIDS Strategy [272] have stressed the importance of eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in HIV health outcomes, thereby signaling the need for culturally targeted HIV care continuum interventions [46,272,294].

---

A.4. **MSM**. African American/Black and Latino MSM are greatly over-represented in the population of PLHA (27%) [45]. Yet these MSM of color have suboptimal rates of linkage to care, retention in care, ART initation, and viral suppression294. Prior epidemiologic research highlights clinical and socio-structural factors that create barriers to engagement along the HIV care continuum for MSM of color. These include HIV and MSM stigmas, substance use, stress, and depression [84,87,234,254,299]. The present study includes a focus on this critical subpopulation of PLHA; 55-60% of males in the present study will be MSM [113,116].

---

A.9. **Proposed study**. In preliminary research, the NYU team identified a set of promising intervention components for African American and Latino PLHA not taking ART and poorly engaged in care, including substance users and MSM [113,116]. An innovative and economical fractional factorial experimental design will be used to examine the effect of each intervention component, its cost effectiveness, as well as mediation and moderation effects for each individual intervention component, providing a detailed look at the mechanisms by which each component works. The optimized intervention developed using this powerful new approach has the potential for a major impact on engagement in HIV care, improving the health of PLHA, reducing forward transmission of HIV, and decreasing disparities – all national priorities [216,272,273,280].

---

A.10. **Summary of significance**. The proposed study has the highest public health significance. 1) Interventions to increase the proportion of PLHA with suppressed viral load are vital. Moreover, reducing HIV/AIDS-related racial/ethnic disparities is a national priority. The proposed project will increase the proportion of PLHA with suppressed viral load within a highly vulnerable population, African American and Latino PLHA not well engaged in HIV care nor taking ART, referred to as “PLHA-NECTA”. At present social/behavioral interventions for this large group of PLHA are sorely lacking, including because they are not appropriate for ART adherence interventions, because they have declined ART. 2) As NIH has emphasized, new research methods such as MOST are urgently needed to advance intervention science, and improve the efficacy and efficiency of behavioral interventions. 3) The proposal is responsive to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and the August 2015 NIH OAR HIV/AIDS priority guidelines (NOT-OD-15-137).

# Innovation

- Typically one paragraph explicitly identifying novel aspects of the work
- **NIH Definition**
  + Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? 
  + Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? 
  + Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?

---

# Writing about Innovation

- Less than one page (½ to ¾ of a page)
- Challenge to/departure from the status quo
- Attainment of new NIH-relevant priorities
