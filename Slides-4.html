# Approach

- Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project?
- Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? 
- If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed?
- If the project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, are the plans to address
  + 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 
  + 2) the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (exclusion) of children, justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed?

# What Goes in Approach?

- Setting
- Inclusion criteria
- Recruitment/Sampling
- Measurement
- Retention
- Activities/Procedures
- Randomization
- Analysis

---

# Setting

- Where?
- Single or multiple sites?
- Clinics, venues, community organizations, street, online
- Field site?
- Accessibility to participants?
- Other people and processes in the setting which may impact the research?

---

# Inclusion Criteria

- Management of variability
  + Selection is a method for controlling variability by design
  + Hard to develop an intervention that is robustly effective when there is substantial population heterogeneity
- Give an explicit list of all eligibility criteria with rationale
  + Age
  + Sexual/gender minority
  + Race/ethnicity
  + History (injection, homeless, incarceration)
  + Behavior or status (unsuppressed HIV viral load; meets criteria for PrEP)
  + Exclusion criteria: language? active psychosis? 

---

# Recruitment/Sampling

- Impacts external validity (to whom do your results apply)
- Random
  + Simple
  + Clustered
- Convenience
- Peer referral
- Advertisements
- Eligible but decline to enroll – why?
- A major aspect of feasibility, so need to keep close track of how recruitment goes over the course of the study, and what you did to improve it

---

# Measurement

- Evidence of reliability and validity
- Modest reliability of a key measure (e.g., α = .60) means a large component is noise, making signals much harder to detect
- Developing new measures is either a major focus of the project or risky
- Organize measures into roles
  + Primary and secondary outcomes
  + Mediators
  + Moderators
  + Covariates/confounders
- Intervention fidelity
- Aspects of acceptability, feasibility, safety

---

# Retention

- If you are doing something longitudinal (more than one study visit/event), a major issue is how well individuals can be retained in the enrolled sample over time
- What strategies will you use to retain?
- A common standard is 80% or more retained
- In formative/developmental work
  + Retention is a major aspect of feasibility, so consider how you will capture and report this “outcome”
  + If you make changes to procedures during the study to improve retention, you want to be able to say clearly how you achieved those improvements 

---

# Activities and Procedures

- If human subjects research, what will each participant experience?
  + Assessments over time
  + Intervention activities
  
---

# Randomization to Conditions

- Balance and allocation concealment
- Simple
- Permuted blocks
- Covariate minimization
- Urn
- Stratification

---

# Analysis

- Organize the analysis plan around your Specific Aims
- Explain the goals of the analysis in plain language
- Address complexities such as missing data and multiple testing
- Power calculations justifying the planned sample size

---

# Approach Example

C.1. **Overview**: The present study of PLHA-NECTA is comprised of three stages: Refinement (6 mos.), Implementation, Cost Effectiveness Analysis, and Optimization (48 mos.), and Final (6 mos.). Five promising individual intervention components will be examined by means of a fractional factorial experiment. All participants (N=512) will receive a Core intervention session and be randomly assigned to an experimental condition. Time and cost expenditure data for each component will be collected. Intervention optimization in stage 2 will proceed as follows: We will first conduct an efficient experiment to assess the efficacy of each component. Based on this, mathematical modeling will determine the most efficacious and cost-effective combination of components, eliminating ineffective components. 

---

C.7.4. **Component A**: MI sessions, ~60 minutes each, 4 sessions. Sessions are conducted with PLHA individually and made up of discrete exercises. Each session includes 1-2 culturally targeted video narrative segments to highlight key issues and foster discussion [134,135]. Session 1 addresses barriers to HIV care. Sessions 2 and 3 target barriers to ART (S2: evoking barriers, fostering readiness; S3: decisions, plans). Session 4 addresses individual barriers and their solutions in depth, and finalizing care/ART plans. Primary theoretical targets: **Health Beliefs, Emotions**

---

C.8.3. The tradeoff for the economy gained by using a fractional factorial design is that some effects become entangled or “aliased.” The fundamental principle underlying fractional factorial designs is to construct a study so the effects of primary interest are aliased with effects not expected to be large or important, typically higher-order interactions. In our design, each main effect is aliased with a four-way interaction, and each two-way interaction is aliased with a three-way interaction. Because our theoretical model (Fig. 3) does not specify any sizeable three-way or four-way interactions, we find this aliasing of effects an acceptable price to pay for a dramatic reduction in research implementation costs.

---

C.16. **Eligibility criteria**: 1) age 18 – 65 years; 2) African American/Black or Latino/Hispanic race/ethnicity; 3) HIV diagnosed for at least 6 months (HIV status confirmed with medical documentation); 4) has not taken ART in the past 6 weeks (the period of time assessed by hair assay, and a reasonable period of time not on ART for the present study); 5) sub-optimal engagement in HIV care (assessed from the medical record, defined as less than 1 visit in every 4-mo. period in the past year [two of them at least 90 days apart], pro-rated for those diagnosed less than a year ago) or &gt; 2 missed visits (without prior cancellation) in the past year209 ...

---

C.27.1. Aim 1: Identify which of 5 components contribute meaningfully to improvement in the primary outcome, viral suppression, as well as, absolute HIV viral load; ART adherence levels; and engagement in HIV care.     
C.27.2. The primary outcome for Aim 1 is viral suppression at the final follow-up point (12-months post-intervention). Logistic regression will be used to estimate effects of components on the odds of viral suppression. Intervention components will be effect coded to estimate main effects and two-way interactions of all five components. The coefficient for a main effect term, multiplied by two and exponentiated, will estimate the effect of the component on the odds of viral suppression ...

# Challenge for Approach

- Write an equation that is directly related to your problem
- Explain what each element of the equation represents and how it relates to a Specific Aim, in plain language
